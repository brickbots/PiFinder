My Celestial Jewel Box – The Guy Pirro 888 Best and Brightest Deep Sky Objects in the Northern Skies

This is my personal deep sky observing list. I use it to line up my DSO targets on any particular night.

Over the years I’ve referred to an earlier version of this list in my monthly night sky postings on Astromart. During that time I’ve received a number of requests from readers to make the complete list available in one place, so here it is (updated) for your use and enjoyment.

Some of the objects listed here can be viewed with binoculars or a small telescope, but the majority will require a moderate to large aperture telescope (7 to 12 inches in diameter) with appropriate filters and a dark sky, especially for many of the nebulae. All the objects in this list can be observed from the northern hemisphere up to around the mid-Northern Latitudes (Princeton, New Jersey -- 40 degrees N).

From my location, the most difficult DSOs to find are those in the southern-most constellations since these objects rise up above the horizon for only a short window of time during the year. And even if you get the timing right, you still need to contend with the atmospheric refraction and haze at the horizon, which adds to the challenge.

This list, “The Guy Pirro 888 Best and Brightest Deep Sky Objects,” is comprised of the following NGC/IC Objects:

- Messier Objects (110 Objects)

- Herschel 400 Objects

- Caldwell Objects visible from 40 degrees N (the 67 northern-most objects) - C1 through C67

- Additional interesting, but somewhat more challenging, NGC/IC Objects (designated P1 through P371). This is a unique set -- There is no overlap between the “P Objects” and the Messier, Herschel, and Caldwell Objects.



Please note that there is, however, some overlap between the Herschel 400 Objects and the Messier and Caldwell Objects. When these overlaps are accounted for and the 371 “P Objects” are added, the total is 888 objects.

Although I’ve aimed to be as thorough as possible in assembling this list, I’ll be grateful to any readers who provide corrections or suggestions for improvement in the comments section below.

I hope you find this list useful.

The night sky is truly a celestial jewel box -- Get outside and explore its wonders from your own backyard.
