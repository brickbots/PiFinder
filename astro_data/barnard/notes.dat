   7  Large, irregular, with brighter condensation (B 10) in SE part
   8  Center of a dark, irregular lane about 2.6 degrees long and 22' + or -
   8  across; very much like the dark lanes E. of Rho Ophiuchi
   9  Dark, irregular vacancy. This is the middle of a great vacancy extending
   9  east and west, the continuous part of which is 2.5 degrees long and about
   9  .5 degree wide. It really extends in a more or less broken form for about
   9  6 degrees. There is a wide region extending south of it for a couple of
   9  degrees, nearly to the star BD +53 750 (magnitude 5.0) whose position is
   9  4h6m58s, N 53 18' (1875.0). To the east it breaks up into more or less
   9  separate spots, somewhat resembling those at the east end of the great
   9  lane from Rho Ophiuchi, but unlike that lane it does not originate in a
   9  larger vacant space or a nebula. Its borders are not so definite as the
   9  Rho Ophiuchi lane. It is approximately bounded by the coordinates 3h58m,
   9  N54.7 and 4h20m, N54.8. The individual positions of some of the spots are
   9  given in the catalogue.
  10  The brightest part of B 7
  11  East end of irregular lane, B 8
  12  Isolated dark spot SE of B 11; irregularly round with extension E. from
  12  the NE side
  13  Irregular; irregularly darker inside with a rather sharp, short, narrow
  13  extension toward the S.
  14  Very small, bright nebula; a bright spot in the dark nebula B 22.
  14  (Position given in Astrophysical Journal, 49, 14, (1919ApJ....49....1B) in
  14  error by 10m in right ascension.)
  15  Elliptical; diameter 15' x 10' slightly NW and SE. One of the finest
  15  examples of a dark object seen against the ordinary sky and away from the
  15  Milky Way. The background on which the stars shine is uniform over the
  15  entire plate. The object is in a region somewhat larger than itself, where
  15  there are relatively few stars, and is black by contrast with the sky
  15  alone. It clearly shows the presence of a feeble uniform luminosity in
  15  space which, from the appearance of similar objects in widely different
  15  parts of the sky, leads to the belief that this feeble illumination of
  15  distant space is universal. If this object were seen against the star
  15  clouds of the Milky Way it would appear strikingly black.
  16  Very small; elongated N and S; close to SE edge of B 15
  17  Very small; elongated N and S; close to E edge of B 15
  18  Group of dark spots
  19  Large, indefinite
  20  In S part of larger, relatively vacant area; this is the dark object
  20  mentioned by Espin in Monthly Notices, 58, 334, (1898MNRAS..58..334E). It
  20  is close north of a small group of faint stars and is 6' or 8' in
  20  diameter. In a somewhat larger vacant space (sic). It is not so definite
  20  as B 15.
  21  Indefinite; irregularly round
  22  Irregular; unequally dark; extended SE and NW; this is a very large region
  22  of obscure nebulosity with several darker streaks in it trending
  22  northwest. It is partly separated from another starless region lying about
  22  2 degrees to the west and north. Near the middle of the first of these
  22  regions is a small luminous nebula with a faint fan-shaped extension for
  22  10' to the northeast (B 14). This is undoubtedly a brighter condensation
  22  of the great obscuring mass surrounding it. The position of this small
  22  nebula is 4h32m20s, N25 30' (1875.0).
  23  Sharply pointed to the SE; BD +29 728 (magnitude 6.5) in N part
  24  Sharply pointed to the S
  25  Irregularly round; a good example of a dark or more or less starless
  25  region
  26  Irregular; B 26, 27, 28 are close NW of BD +30 741 (mag 6.8), which is
  26  involved in feeble nebulosity
  27  Irregular
  28  Irregular
  29  Round; indefinite
  30  Large dark area with few stars. There is a nebulous border, .5 degree
  30  wide, to the semi-vacant region extending 1 degree east and north from BD
  30  +12 803 (magnitude 7.0). Apparently this nebulous border extends many
  30  degrees east in a very diffused manner. There is a narrow dark lane
  30  extending south from the semi-vacant region, running close west of BD +12
  30  803 to a point nearly 1 degree south of BD +12 801 (mag 6.9). There is a
  30  small fan-shaped nebula close north of a small star in the position
  30  5h24m30s, +12 3.9' (1875.0). A small strip of nebulosity extends 5'
  30  southwest from this star. These two nebulae are probably the brighter
  30  parts of a large obscure nebulosity.
  31  Extended NE and SW; the E. and darkest part of B 30
  32  Dark projection from S. end of B 31 to the E.
  33  Dark mass, on nebulous strip extending S from Zeta Orionis (see
  33  Astrophysical Journal, 38, 500, (1913ApJ....38..496B), and Plate XX)
  34  Round; starless; indefinite
  35  Elongated E and W, 20'x10', with an extension SE; three small stars N of
  35  it
  36  Irregular, narrow dark lane, NE and SW. The NE end connects brokenly with
  36  B 35. Well shown on Plate 21, Lick Observatory Publications, 11, 1913.
  37  Irregular, semi-vacant region. This region is abruptly terminated on the S
  37  side by the nebulosity extending north from 15 Monocerotis. Its west side
  37  ends abruptly at 6h22m15s, +12 26' (1875.0). B 37, 38, and 39 are shown in
  37  Plates 28 and 29, Lick Observatory Publications, 11, 1913.
  38  Irregular vacancy. This seems to refer to a portion of B 37.
  39  Small, sharply defined, elongated spot in the nebulosity NW of 15
  39  Monocerotis
  40  Diffused dark spot; small star in it. This spot and B 41 are connected
  40  with the great nebula about Nu Scorpii and are doubtless denser opaque
  40  masses of the nebula. There is a larger dark region belonging to this same
  40  system in 16h23m, -19 30' (1875.0) (B 43), from which broken dark lanes
  40  somewhat like those from Rho Ophiuchi, though less marked, run eastward
  40  for some degrees.
  41  Diffused dark spot
  42  Great nebula of Mu Ophiuchi; this object is put in the list because,
  42  though not wholly dark, it is partly so, and the evident obscuration
  42  produced by it puts it in the class for which the catalogue is made. The
  42  semi-vacant region in which this, the great nebula of Rho Ophiuchi, lies
  42  is about 3.5 degrees in diameter. For references to the visual discovery
  42  and early observations of this strange region see Astronomische
  42  Nachrichten, 138, 211, 1895; Popular Astronomy 5, 227, 1897; 14, 581,
  42  1906; Lick Observatory Publications, 11, 19, 1913 and Plate 36.
  43  Large dark region
  44  Dark lane E. from Rho Ophiuchi region. This is the middle of the main part
  44  of the great vacant lane that runs east from the region of Rho Ophiuchi.
  44  It is about 32' wide and has its beginning in a vacant area in which is
  44  the star 22 Scorpii (CD -24 12695, magnitude 5.5). It runs slightly
  44  northeast to about 16h40m, -23 40' (1875.0). From this point it extends in
  44  a broken chain of dark spots to a little south of B 63. Its total length
  44  is therefore about 10 degrees.
  44a Irregular; sharpest on SE side; CD -40 10662 (mag 9.0) close N. Apparently
  44a a real, dark object.
  45  Rather definite; Extended NE and SW with an irregular projection SW that
  45  connects it with the Rho Ophiuchi region. This appears to be a real, dark
  45  object.
  46  Irregular; definite; a string of small stars in the middle
  47  Irregular; definite; connected with B 51 by two sharp lanes
  48  Fairly well defined; 15' W and N of CD -40 11088 (magnitude 8); seems to
  48  be a real object
  49  Small; close SE of and involving CD -33 11668 (magnitude 9.3).
  50  Large, irregular dark space; this is an irregular square, sharply defined
  50  on the east side and diffused on the west, where there are broken
  50  extensions for 30'. The star CD -34 11418 (magnitude 9.8) is near the
  50  middle. The stars CD -34 11422 (magnitude 9.8) and -34 11427 (magnitude
  50  9.9) are on the eastern border.
  51  Definite; one of a straggling group toward the eastern end of the dark
  51  lane from Rho Ophiuchi. Two irregular, dark lanes run west from it to B
  51  47.
  53  Large; diffuse; extended N and S by 30'; curved toward the E at N end
  54  Small; round; close S. of magnitude 11 star
  55  Irregular; best defined SE.; CD -31 13582 (magnitude 8.9) near the center
  56  Small; close E of CD -31 13609 (magnitude 9.0). This seems to be a real
  56  object
  57  Elongated NE and SW
  58  Slightly extended N and S; a darker core at NE side
  59  Sink hole; at the W end of a wide broken lane from B 78
  60  Curved; extended NE and SW; this and B 57 are the most distinct of a group
  60  of dark spots SW of the square end of B 63.
  61  Small; elongated E and W
  62  Very black in NW part; brightest of three stars in S part is BD -20 4690
  62  (magnitude 9.4). Apparently a real object.
  63  Large, definite, curved figure, convex to N; the W end abrupt; 97' E and
  63  W, 19' wide
  64  Cometary; W of M 9; This object is somewhat cometary in form and has a
  64  very black core or head that sharply abuts against the thick stratum of
  64  stars; from this it spreads out into a large dark area with much dark
  64  detail, filling quite a space close southwest of M 9. It thus resembles a
  64  dark comet with a dense and well-defined head and diffused widening tail.
  64  The position of the head is 17h9m57s, -18 20.6 (1875.0).
  65  Definite; elongated; 12' E and W

  70  Sharply defined on W side
  71  Very small; extends 1.25', plus or minus
  72  S-shaped; this is a striking object. It is a thin, curved black marking,
  72  the exact form of the letter S or the figure 5, as the imagination or
  72  point of view may dictate. The SE branch runs E for some distance passing
  72  close S of the star CD -23 13376 (magnitude 9.1). Its average thickness is
  72  about 2'-3'. The position in the catalogue is for the southern part of the
  72  figure, or the bottom of the S (see Astrophysical Journal, 49,
  72  (1919ApJ....49....1B), Plate III).
  73  Very small; extended N and S 4'

  77  Indefinite; connected by a vacant strip with B 78
  78  Very large; CD -26 12152 (magnitude 6.2) S of the middle. This vacant
  78  region, with its extension to the west running south of Theta Ophiuchi, is
  78  visible to the naked eye (see Popular Astronomy, 14, 580, 1906.)

  84a center; perhaps some detail in it
  85  Trifid nebula. This is the southern part of the Trifid nebula, NGC 6514.
  85  The dark markings in this nebula are too well known to insert in this
  85  catalogue.
  86  Diam. 5'; edge of diffused nebulosity. For the visual discovery of this
  86  object see Astronomische Nachrichten 108, 370, 1884.

  87  stars in it CD -32 13666 (magnitude 9.6) on NW edge. CD -32 13687 (9.6) on
  87  SE edge.
  88  Extended N and S; 2.7'x0.5'; in M8. There are other well-known markings in
  88  this nebula. This one and B 89 are given as illustrations of dark markings
  88  in the sky shown in relief against a nebulous or other luminous
  88  background. In this case there may be non-luminous opaque parts of the
  88  nebula itself.

 168  Small nebula at E end of dark lane. This nebula is 10' in diameter with
 168  over a dozen stars of different magnitudes in it. There is no central
 168  condensation, nor does the nebula condense about any of the stars. There
 168  are some dark markings in it. The dark lane is 1.7 degrees long and 9'
 168  wide (see Lick Observatory Publications, 11, Plate 81).

 173  Diam. 4'; rather definite; a small star on N edge and one on SW edge
 174  Narrow; irregular; 19' long NE and SW
 175  Large; diam. 1 degree; bright nebula in N part. This is a large dark spot,
 175  extended north and south, 62' in its largest diameter. In its upper part
 175  is the star BD +69 1231 (magnitude 8.8), which is nebulous. This is
 175  apparently a large dark nebula, the brighter part of which forms the star
 175  +69 1231. In Monthly Notices, 69 (1908MNRAS..69..117W), Dr. Max Wolf gives
 175  a photograph of the nebula, stating that the object was discovered by Dr.
 175  Kopff at Heidelberg on October 12, 1908. It is conspicuous on a photograph
 175  of mine made with the Willard lens at the Lick Observatory, September 24,
 175  1895, with 5h0m exposure. It is also shown on a photograph of mine made
 175  with the Bruce telescope, July 20, 1904, with an exposure of 3h1m. By
 175  inadvertence reference to this object was omitted in Lick Observatory
 175  Publications, 11, where it is cut out by the matting in Plate 83.
