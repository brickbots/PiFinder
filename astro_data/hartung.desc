Astronomical Objects for Southern Telescopes (Melbourne University Press, 1968) contains 1129 objects observed by Professor Ernst Johannes Hartung 1893-1979.  Hartung was a Professor of Chemistry at the University of Melbourne until he retired in 1953.  He built his telescope, a equatorially mounted 30cm Newtonian Reflector.  All observations were from his observatory at Lavender Farm, Woodend, Victoria.  His work was republished by David Malin and David J Frew in 1994 (second Edition), titled Hartung's Astronomical Objects for Southern Telescopes.
