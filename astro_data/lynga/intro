                         ______________________________

                           5th edition, February 1987


    This is a computer readable catalogue of open cluster data compiled by Gosta
Lynga, Lund Observatory, Box 43, S-221 00 Lund, Sweden.  It is distributed by
the Stellar Data Centre, Observatoire de Strasbourg 11 rue de l'Universite, F-67
000 Strasbourg, France and by World Data Center A, Goddard Space Flight Center,
Code 630.2, Greenbelt, Maryland 20771, USA.

    The following description of the machine-readable version of the "Catalogue
of Open Cluster Data, 5th Edition" is based on the documentation received by
Gosta Lynga in 1987.  Additional comments and revisions have since been made to
his description.  These changes were warrented because of the format
modifications made to the catalogue data, mainly files 2 and 5. These particular
files are now in a computer readable format.  Files 2 and 4, however, remain
strictly print files.

    The aim of this catalogue is to give salient data for all known open star
clusters in our galaxy.  As far as possible only published data values have been
quoted; for some of the parameters these values have been selected from
references, which are listed.

    In the fifth edition some minor updates have been made from the fourth
edition.  The main difference between the fifth edition and the fourth is the
merging of the data resulting from a joint project between K. Janes, C. Duke and
Lynga (the paper, which is in preparation, is referred to as jdl).  The aim of
that project was to discuss properties of the open cluster system by using
existing data and by taking their accuracy into proper regard.  Thus the data
were assessed (mostly by Janes), weights assigned and weighted mean values
derived of reddenings, turn-off colours and distances.  These data have been
entered into files 2 and 6 and the references used have been merged into file 3.
Lines 35-38 refer to these entries of file 3.

    As before, file 6 contains all the material of the catalogue whereas the
table (file 2) only contains the most essential items.  Files 1, 2, and 4 are
page oriented and thus adapted for microfiche and print-out use while file 6
contains one record of 528 bytes for each cluster; in order to allow use of
programs developed for the fourth edition the same byte numbers have been kept
for bytes 1- 462.  Also the old cluster locations have been kept for the sake of
consistency.  The drawback of this is that some locations are empty - they are
then filled with blanks.

    The definitions of the data values are in most cases unambiguous.  However,
the following points should be clarified.  The line numbers refer to the page
oriented catalogue of file 2.

    CLUSTER DIAMETER.  In the literature some quite convincing cases have been
made for the existence of large coronas around open clusters.  This may be a
general phenomenon, although for most clusters only the diameter of the cluster
nucleus is known.  For reasons of homogeneity, this is used even when the
existence of a cluster corona is likely.  For most clusters two values of the
angular diameter are given.  Estimates from survey prints (line 22 in file 2)
should form a reasonably homogeneous sample.  Line 23 contains the most
reliable, often the only, value available in the literature.  The linear
diameter given in line 58 assumes the jdl distance of line 25, if available, or
the selected distance of line 26.  The angular diameter of line 22 is used.

    The jdl distance with corresponding weight is given in line 25.  Line 26
contains the most accurate single determination of the distance with
corresponding reference number.

    Line 29 contains the turn-off colour and the corresponding weight.  In line
30 the age derived from the turn-off colour is given.  All this information is
from jdl.  The most accurate log(age) determination from the literature is given
in line 31 together with corresponding reference number.

    INTERSTELLAR EXTINCTION.  Contrary to earlier editions the observed
reddening value is now given rather than the derived extinction.  The jdl data
with weights are given in line 27.  The letter 'v' means that there is variable
reddening over the cluster.

    METALLICITY.  The abundance values were discussed by jdl and an attempt was
made to put them on a homogeneous system.  The resulting value is entered in
line 32.

    RADIAL VELOCITIES.  The data for cluster radial velocities have been
collected by Dr.  S. Wramdemark of Lund Observatory (ref 520).  They represent
weighted mean values for member stars velocities as published up to 1980.  The
weighting procedure takes into account the number of stars in the cluster for
which radial velocity had been measured, the accuracy (Wilson class) for each
stellar radial velocity and the calculated imprecision in the mean radial
velocity for the cluster.  Five weight classes are identified by w= 1, 2, 3, 4
and 5 in order of increasing precision.

    INTEGRATED PROPERTIES.  The total V magnitude and the integrated B-V colour
have been calculated by mr.  B. Skiff (ref 422), Flagstaff, Arizona, using
available photometric data.  The number of observed stars used is sometimes
different from estimates of membership from survey charts.  Reasons for such
differences can be inclusions of non-members or limited resolution on the survey
charts.  Skiff's data are given in lines 50-52.  The richness class of line 53
is from Janes and Adler (ref 265).

         reference 19 or 320. If considered  dubious  by  both  these
         references, the cluster has been removed from the catalogue


FILE 3. Reference File:

    The organisation of the reference section has been reconsidered and instead
of the division in different section, file 3 now contains all references in
alphabetical order.  Each reference is formatted to 264 characters, i.e.
suitable for print-out with 132 characters per line.  The sequential numbers are
stored in the relevant places of files 2 and 6. Naturally, these numbers are
only valid inside this edition.

     The following is the format for the Reference file:

           Bytes             Description

            1-  4            Reference Number. A blank in this
                             field indicates a continuation of
                             the previous record
                5            Blank
            6-132            Full reference


FILE 4. Alias File:

    The alias listing is arranged in right ascension.  Cluster names and OCL
numbers are given as well as alternative names that have been used.  Comments
are also given as to identity of clusters in relation to other neighbouring
clusters.  Comments from the NGC catalogue are included for NGC clusters.  This
file also gives information on some clusters which have been considered doubtful
by two independent sources, and which thus have been cancelled as entries in the
catalogue.

    At the end of the alias listing there is a cross reference table for
clusters which have more than one name in addition to the IAU notation.


FILE 5. Galactic Coordinate File:

    The following table describes the format of this file, sorted by increasing
galactic longitude.  (Also note that it is in order of increasing OCL number).
The orginal format was in tabular form, having two columns per page.  The
columns were appended in order to allow computer readability.


           Bytes        Format           Description

            1- 8         F8.2            Galactic Longitude

    CLUSTER NOTATION.  When this is the NGC number, it is in the follow format
(bytes 35-42) NGC nnnn.


FILE 6. Catalogue Data File:

    This file is the most comprehensive one, being a direct copy of the Lund
disc file at the time of submitting the present version to the CDS and NASA data
centres.  This catalogue contains information about one cluster in each group of
four lines i.e. 528 bytes.  The contents of the first 462 bytes are on the same
format as was used for the fourth edition; this will allow the use of the same
reading program.  However, bytes 463-520 contain new data, resulting from the
jdl investigation.

    The following is a listing of catalogue contents, which notes the formats
and byte numbers in file 6 and the names and storage positions in the Lund data
base; references are made to equivalences inside the four matrices used there:
rda, ref, isd and name.
