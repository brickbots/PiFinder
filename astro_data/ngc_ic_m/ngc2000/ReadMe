Description:
    NGC 2000.0 is a modern compilation of the New General Catalogue of
    Nebulae and Clusters of Stars (NGC), the Index Catalogue (IC), and the
    Second Index Catalogue compiled by J. L. E. Dreyer (1888, 1895, 1908).
    The new compilation of these classical catalogs is intended to meet
    the needs of present-day observers by reporting positions at equinox
    B2000.0 and by incorporating the corrections reported by Dreyer
    himself and by a host of other astronomers who have worked with the
    data and compiled lists of errata. The object types given are those
    known to modern astronomy. The catalog lists object ID, object type,
    positions in equinox B2000.0, source of modern data (see NGC 2000
    paperback copy), constellation, object size, magnitude, and the
    description of the object as given by Dreyer. The order of the new
    catalog is strictly by right ascension, the NGC and IC objects being
    merged into one machine-readable file.

     Gb  = Globular star cluster, usually in the Milky Way Galaxy
     Nb  = Bright emission or reflection nebula
     Pl  = Planetary nebula

Note (2): sources that have been used to correct or update
    modern data in NGC 2000.0 (type, positions, magnitude, and size).
    Uppercase letters denote special NGC and IC errata lists, which have
    usually been accorded more weight than the source catalogues
    themselves. In parentheses after each citation is the number of times
    it has been used to update NGC entries (first number) and those in
    the IC (second number).

History by Wayne H. Warren Jr., December 1989:
        It is important, even for users of the machine-readable catalog
    and this documentation, to also have a copy of the published book.
    In addition to the tables and reference sources mentioned in this
    document, the book provides an introductory section with a brief
    history of the NGC and IC catalogs, a count of objects by
    constellation, information on Dreyer's descriptions, a table cross
    index of Messier and NGC/IC designations, and a table of common names
    for NGC objects. The book also contains a table of right ascensions
    for NGC and IC objects.
        A magnetic tape containing NGC 2000.0 was received from
    William E. Shawcross of Sky Publishing Corporation on August 14, 1989.
    According to Mr. Shawcross, the file supplied to the ADC was an
    unmodified version of the one used to produce the book, and it still
    contained the TEX commands employed to produce the special symbols
    present in the printed version. As received, the file also contained a
    single copyright text record at its beginning. The text record was
    removed to an added first file in the archived version and
    supplemented with a small amount of additional information. The TEX in
    the data file was replaced by standard characters to represent the
    information. Special symbols, such as "\Delta", "\bigcirc", etc., were
    changed to their spelled-out equivalents.
        The size field was modified to add decimal points to integer
    numbers and to align all values properly so that the field can be
    processed with a single format specification. The magnitude field was
    modified by moving the "p" code for photographic magnitude to its own
    byte in order to remove it from the numerical field. Decimal points
    were added to all integer numbers in this field also.
        The catalog data file was run through the ADC General
    Verification Program, which checks data ranges and for various other
    problems that can be detected in a systematic way.

Further history:
    The standardised document was generated in April 1977 at CDS
    (James Marcout, Francois Ochsenbein).

Acknowledgements:
    Appreciation is expressed to William E. Shawcross for responding to a
    request from the ADC to make NGC 2000.0 available to the scientific
    community in machine-readable form. Mr. Shawcross also arranged for a
    copy of the machine-readable TEX file to be created for deposit in the
    archives of the data centers. I am grateful to both Mr. Shawcross and
    to Roger W. Sinnott for reviewing a draft copy of this document and
    making comments. The comments resulted in the finding and elimination
    of a few TEX symbols that were missed during the initial work.

    The meticulous documentation initiated by Wayne H. Warren at ADC
    (December 1989) is the basis of the present document.
