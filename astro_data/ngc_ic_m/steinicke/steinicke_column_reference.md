# Revised Column Explanations

| Column | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| N | Catalogue prefix: N (NGC) or I (IC) |
| NI | Catalogue number. Some objects have an extension letter (A, B, C, ...) |
| A | Extension letter: A, B, C... |
| C | Components. If two or more different objects use the same NGC or IC number, these are numbered as components (1, 2, 3, ...). This is also applied for objects associated with the main entry. |
| D | Dreyer Object. A * marks that this is the object meant in Dreyer's catalogue (many objects with extension letters are not in the original NGC/IC). |
| S | Status. Status of the identification (see Tab. 2) |
| P | Precision. Flag for high precision position |
| CON | Constellation |
| RH, RM, RS | Right ascension. Equinox J2000.0 |
| V, DG, DM, DS | Declination. Equinox J2000.0 |
| Bmag | Photographic (blue) magnitude |
| Vmag | Visual magnitude |
| B-V | Difference of visual and blue magnitude |
| SB | Surface brightness (mag/arcmin²) |
| X, Y | Larger/smaller diameter ('). If only one value is given, this refers to the maximum size. |
| PA | Position angle (°). The position angle is only relevant for galaxies, and given if possible. |
| Type | Type of object |
| z | Redshift (from NED or LEDA) |
| D(z) | Distance derived from z in Mpc, using D(z) = cz/H₀, with Hubble Parameter H₀ = 71 (km/s)/Mpc |
| Dist | Metric distance: for galaxies with S = 1, 6, 7 or 8 in Mpc (from NED); for other types with S = 2, 3, 4, or 5 in kpc |
| PGC | PGC-number. Object listed in the *Catalog of Principal Galaxies* |
| ID1 - ID11 | Identifications; the last non-empty field contains remarks (if any) |
