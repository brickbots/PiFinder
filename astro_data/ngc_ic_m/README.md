# NGC, IC & Messier Object Catalogs

This directory contains the astronomical catalogs used by PiFinder for NGC (New General Catalogue), IC (Index Catalogue), and Messier objects.

## Directory Structure

### steinicke/
The **Steinicke catalog** is the primary and most comprehensive source for NGC, IC, and Messier objects in PiFinder. This catalog provides:

- Modern, accurate coordinates (J2000.0)
- Detailed object classifications and types
- Physical properties (magnitudes, sizes, surface brightness)
- Cross-references and identifications
- Based on Wolfgang Steinicke's comprehensive revision of the NGC/IC catalogs

**Key files:**
- `NI2023.xls` - Main catalog data (extracted from zip)
- `NI2024.zip` - Original source archive
- `extract.py` - Python script to process XLS data into JSON format
- `explanation.md` - Detailed column documentation

### ngc2000/
The **NGC2000 catalog** is used supplementarily to provide **object descriptions** that are missing from the Steinicke catalog. While Steinicke provides comprehensive technical data, NGC2000 contains the descriptive text that helps observers understand what they're looking at.

**Key files:**
- `ngc2000.dat` - Catalog data with descriptions
- `names.dat` - Object name cross-references
- `ReadMe` - Format documentation

## How They Work Together

1. **Primary Data Source**: Steinicke catalog provides the main object database with accurate coordinates, magnitudes, and classifications
2. **Descriptions**: NGC2000 catalog supplements this with human-readable descriptions of objects
3. **Integration**: PiFinder's catalog import system combines both sources to create a complete object database

## Usage in PiFinder

The combined catalog data is processed and imported into PiFinder's SQLite database (`pifinder_objects.db`) during the catalog import process. The import system in `python/PiFinder/catalog_imports/` handles merging data from both sources.

## Data Sources

- **Steinicke**: Wolfgang Steinicke's revised NGC/IC catalog (http://www.klima-luft.de/steinicke/)
- **NGC2000**: NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database NGC2000 catalog
