# PiFinder v3 PCB Files

These files are for producing the surface mount boards used in the v3 PiFinder.
They are probably not the files you are looking for.  To build the DIY version
of the PiFinder with through-hole parts, use the gerber files in the directory
above this one.

These files require reflow soldering to assemble, even if you are good at 
hand soldering SMT parts.  The BNO055 package has leads under it that are 
impossible to solder by hand.

More than most of the files in this repo, these are very much provided AS IS
and will require a good amount of skill to assemble.


## Bill of Materials

There is a csv BOM file here with designators, part numbers, descriptions
and values.  These include the specific JLCPCB part numbers, but you should
be able to source these parts from any supplier.  To verify specific values
please use the provided part numbers and the database at https://jlcpcb.com/parts
