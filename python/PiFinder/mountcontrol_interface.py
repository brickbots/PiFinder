""" Module for controlling the telescope mount. 

The MountControlBase class provides the main control loop and shared logic for mount control. 
The split of responsibilities between the base class and subclasses is as follows:

- The MountControlBase class manages the MountControlPhase and calls the appropriate methods on the subclass based on the current phase.
- The subclass is responsible for implementing the hardware-specific logic for each phase, such as initializing the mount, moving to a target.
  This also involves handling mount state, such as parked and unparked.

"""


class MountControlPhases(Enum):
    """
    Enumeration representing the various phases and states of controlling the telescope mount.

    States:
        MOUNT_INIT_TELESCOPE:
            Telescope needs to be initialized, connected to, settings need to be set, encoders switched on, unparked etc.
        MOUNT_STOPPED:
            The mount is stopped and is not tracking or moving. Basically we wait for user selection of a target.
            This is the state after initialization and before target acquisition.
        MOUNT_TARGET_ACQUISITION_MOVE:
            The user has selected a target and the mount being commanded to move to it. The mount slews to the selected target.
            and we wait for it to finish slewing. This state may be entered from MOUNT_TARGET_ACQUISITION_REFINE multiple times.
        MOUNT_TARGET_ACQUISITION_REFINE:
            The mount believes it has acquired the target, and now we use PiFinder's platesolved position to refine its position and put
            the target into the center of the field of view.
        MOUNT_DRIFT_COMPENSATION:
            We have reached the target and put it in the center of the field of view. The mount is tracking and
            we are compensating for drift (due to polar alignment being off).
        MOUNT_TRACKING:
            The mount is tracking the sky but we are not doing drift compensation. This is entered, if the user moves the telescope manually.
        MOUNT_SPIRAL_SEARCH:
            The mount has been commanded to a spiral search pattern to find a target.

    Note that a user interaction may at any time move the mount back to MOUNT_STOPPED, or put it into MOUNT_TRACKING.
    Once in drift compensation mode, the user may also select a new target, which will move the phase to MOUNT_TARGET_ACQUISITION_MOVE.
    Any error condition should actively abort any movement and set the state to MOUNT_INIT_TELESCOPE.

    This enum is used in the main control loop to decide on what action to take next.

    Base class for mount control interfaces.

    This class defines the interface and shared logic for controlling a telescope mount.
    It is intended to be subclassed by specific mount implementations, which must override
    the abstract methods to provide hardware-specific functionality.

    Responsibilities of MountControlBase:
    - Manage shared state, communication queues, and logging for mount control.
    - Define the main control loop (`run`) and initialization sequence.
    - Provide abstract methods for mount initialization, movement, and position retrieval.

    Responsibilities of subclasses:
    - Implement hardware-specific logic of mount.
    - Handle communication with the actual mount hardware or protocol.
    - Call notification methods to inform the base class of mount state changes.

    Abstract methods to override in subclasses:
        init_mount(): Initialize the mount hardware and prepare for operation.
        sync_mount(current_position_radec): Synchronize the mount's pointing state.
        move_mount_to_target(target_position_radec): Move the mount to the specified target position.
        set_mount_drift_rates(drift_rate_ra, drift_rate_dec): Set the mount's drift rates.
        spiral_search(center_position_radec, max_radius_deg, step_size_deg): Perform a spiral search.
        move_mount_manual(direction, speed, duration): Move the mount manually in a specified direction and speed.

    Notification methods for subclasses to call:
        mount_current_position(current_mount_position_radec): Report current mount position.
        mount_target_reached(): Notify that the mount has reached the target.
        mount_stopped(): Notify that the mount has stopped moving.

    Methods to override:
        init(): Initialize the mount hardware and prepare for operation.
        disconnect(): Safely disconnect from the mount hardware.
        move_to_position(position): Move the mount to the specified position.
        get_current_position(): Retrieve the current position of the mount.
    Main loop:
        The `run` method manages the main control loop, calling `init` on startup and
        handling graceful shutdown on interruption.
