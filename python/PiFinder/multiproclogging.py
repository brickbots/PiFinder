"""
This module provides a sink process for all logging in PiFinder

Due to `logging` not being compatible out of the box with concurrency using processes, the logging cookbook recommends to use
the approach implemented here: A single process that is fed log records using `Queue`s.

    """
    Class implementing the approach for multi process logging, explained here:
    https://docs.python.org/dev/howto/logging-cookbook.html#logging-to-a-single-file-from-multiple-processes

    log_conf: the logging configuration file to read in and apply (when instantiating)
    out_file: the log file to write to.
    formatter: the format specification used to log records to the file.

    Shortcomings
    ------------
     * The implememtation assumes that the log configuration read in is propagated to new processes. **This is not true on Windows!**

    Prerequisite
    ------------
      * You should have all your logging configuration in a single configuration file, that applies to all processes!

    How to use this
    ===============

     0) In the main process of your software, create an instance of this class,
        passing in the location of your logging configuration file and which logfile to use.
     1) Retrieve the needed queues from this instance, using `get_queue()`.
        The respective queues need to be passed on to the processes, see 3)
     2) Before spawning any other processes, `start()` the log storage in a separate process.
     2) when starting up each process, pass in the queues retrieved in step 1)
        This should a different queue for each process.
     3) In the newly running process, call `MultiprocLogging.configurer(queue)`, which then applies the logging configuration to forward
        to the log process writing to the file.

    If you want to also capture all logging before you start the logging process (step 2), you can call configurer() also in the main process
    Note that calls to get_queue() _after_ starting do **not** propagate to the logging process. So you have to create all queues you need beforehand.

    Note that timestamps are generated on creation of the log record (when you call `debug()` and friends), they may not be in order in the log file though.

    Implementation note
    -------------------

    The class calls the respective loggers `handle()`  method, so in order to avoid an endless logging loop (where calling `handle` results in a new entry in the queue),
    all handlers propagated from the main process are discarded in the logging process and only the filehandler is used.
