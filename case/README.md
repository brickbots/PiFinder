# PiFinder Case Parts Readme 

In this directory you'll find STL's for all the parts of the PiFinder.  You won't need all these pieces for any one build.  There are a few options so please read through the [build guide](https://pifinder.readthedocs.io/en/release/build_guide.html) and especially the [printed parts guide](https://pifinder.readthedocs.io/en/release/build_guide.html#printed-parts) before you start printing.   Reach out to [info@pifinder.io](mailto:info@pifinder.io) or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Nk5fHcAtWD) to ask any questions.

## Versions
The current case version is Version 2, this is designed for either the internal GPS module or external USB dongle.  The Version 1 files are still available for reference and replacment on previous version builds.  Please see the appropriate subdirectory for each.

## PiSugar
The internal battery option has proven so popular that all case configurations now accomodate the PiSugar battery and control board. 

## Adapters

In the adapters subdirectory you'll find different options and adapters for fixing your PiFinder to your telescope. 

At the moment there's an adapter solution for [Rigel Quickfinder's base plates](adapters/quikfinder).
