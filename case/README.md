# PiFinder Case Parts Readme 

In these directories you'll find STL's for all the parts of the PiFinder.
You won't need all these pieces for any one build.  There are a few options so
please read through the [build guide](https://pifinder.readthedocs.io/en/release/build_guide.html) 
and especially the [printed parts guide](https://pifinder.readthedocs.io/en/release/build_guide.html#printed-parts) 
before you start printing.   
Reach out to [info@pifinder.io](mailto:info@pifinder.io) or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Nk5fHcAtWD) 
to ask any questions.

## Versions

### DIY v2.5
The current DIY version of the PiFinder is the v2.5 and you can find all the parts for various
configurations in the v2.5 directory.  If you have purchased a kit or ordered PCB's and parts
from the BOM, this is the version you are building.

The v2.5 is functionally identical to the v3, runs the 
same software and performs the same, but the v2.5
has electronics that can be assembled by hand and the case design is easier to print/assemble.
Build instructions on the site are for the v2.5.


### Assembled v3

Case parts and PCB designs for the v3 are available here for reference, but there is no build 
guide and we can't support DIY v3 builds as the electronics MUST be assembled
via reflow soldering and are not able to be built by hand.  If you've
ordered a kit or otherwise hand-assembled your electronics, you'll want to follow the v2.5 build
guide and print the v2.5 parts.

## PiSugar
The internal battery option has proven so popular that all case configurations now accomodate the PiSugar battery and control board. 

## Adapters

In the adapters subdirectory you'll find different options and adapters for fixing your PiFinder to your telescope. 

At the moment there's an adapter solution for [Rigel Quickfinder's base plates](adapters/quikfinder).
