# PiFinder Case Parts Readme 

In these directories you'll find STL's for all the parts of the PiFinder.
You won't need all these pieces for any one build.  There are a few options so
please read through the [build guide](https://pifinder.readthedocs.io/en/release/build_guide.html) 
and especially the [printed parts guide](https://pifinder.readthedocs.io/en/release/build_guide.html#printed-parts) 
before you start printing.   
Reach out to [info@pifinder.io](mailto:info@pifinder.io) or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Nk5fHcAtWD) 
to ask any questions.

## Versions

The current DIY version of the PiFinder is the v2.5 and you can find all the parts for various
configurations in the v2.5 directory.  The v2.5 is functionally identical to the v3, runs the 
same software and performs the same, but the v2.5
has electronics that can be assembled by hand and the case design is easier to print/assemble.
Build instructions on the site are for the v2.5.

Case parts and PCB designs for the v3 are available here, but the electronics MUST be assembled
via reflow soldering and are not able to be built by hand so there is no build guide.

## PiSugar
The internal battery option has proven so popular that all case configurations now accomodate the PiSugar battery and control board. 

## Adapters

In the adapters subdirectory you'll find different options and adapters for fixing your PiFinder to your telescope. 

At the moment there's an adapter solution for [Rigel Quickfinder's base plates](adapters/quikfinder).
